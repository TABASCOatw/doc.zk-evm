## Smart Wallet-as-a-Service on Linea

[Particle Network](https://particle.network/) is the intent-centric, modular access layer of Web3. With Particle's Smart Wallet-as-a-Service, developers can curate an seamless user experience through modular and customizable EOA/AA embedded wallet components. Using MPC-TSS for key management, Particle can streamline user onboarding via familiar web2 accounts - such as Google accounts, email addresses, and phone numbers. 

Particle Network's Smart Wallet-as-a-Service is compatible with Linea through both usage of EOAs (traditional accounts) and AA (smart accounts). This AA support extends to Particle Network's [in-house Bundler](https://docs.particle.network/developers/account-abstraction/rpc/bundler-rpc) and [Omnichain Paymaster](https://docs.particle.network/developers/account-abstraction/paymaster) infrastructure, both of which are compatible with Linea.

Thus, developers can leverage Particle Network to onboard users into smart accounts using social login, then facilitate full-stack ERC-4337 account abstraction through it's [native AA SDKs](https://docs.particle.network/developers/account-abstraction/sdks), available across six platforms.
